# Async Counter

A simple counter application demonstrating JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities and event handling.

## Project Overview

This project implements a counter with async increment and decrement operations, showcasing JavaScript's event loop and callback handling.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement asynchronous operations in JavaScript
- Understand event handling and UI updates
- Practice working with callbacks and timeouts
- Experience single-threaded behavior in practice

## Features

- Increment counter with delay
- Decrement counter with delay
- Display current count
- Visual feedback during operations
- Disable buttons during async operations

## Technical Requirements

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for functionality
- No external libraries required

## Implementation Details

The project should demonstrate:

1. Async counter updates using setTimeout
2. Event handlers for button clicks
3. UI state management during async operations
4. Error handling for edge cases

## Project Structure

```

├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js

```

## Development Guidelines

1. Use async callbacks for counter operations
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Maintain responsive UI during operations
4. Follow clean code practices
5. Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

- Test counter limits
- Verify async operation timing
- Check UI responsiveness
- Validate error scenarios

## Future Enhancements

1. Add animation effects
2. Implement custom timing
3. Add operation history
4. Save state in localStorage
